# NodeJS and MongoDB Project

This project is a Node.js application that utilizes MongoDB as the database and incorporates middleware for authentication and error handling. The purpose of this project is to provide a foundation for building secure and reliable web applications using Node.js and MongoDB.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd nodejs-mongodb-project
   ```

3. Install the dependencies using npm:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Configure the MongoDB connection:

   - Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
   - Open the `.env` file and update the `MONGODB_URI` variable with your MongoDB connection string.

## Usage

To run the project, execute the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will start the Node.js server, and you can access the application by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Middleware

### Authentication

The project incorporates authentication middleware to protect certain routes or resources. To implement authentication, the following steps were taken:

1. Users can register for an account by providing a username and password.
2. Upon successful registration, the user's password is securely hashed and stored in the database.
3. Users can then log in using their credentials, and a JSON Web Token (JWT) is generated and returned.
4. For routes that require authentication, clients must include the JWT in the `Authorization` header of their requests.
5. The server verifies the JWT, and if it is valid, allows access to the protected resource.

### Error Handling

The project also includes middleware for error handling. The error handling middleware intercepts any errors that occur during request processing and provides appropriate error responses to the client. Some common scenarios where error handling is applied include:

- Validation errors: When user input fails validation, such as missing or invalid fields.
- Database errors: When there are issues with database operations, such as failed queries or constraints violations.
- Unauthorized access: When a user attempts to access a protected resource without proper authentication.
- General server errors: When unexpected errors occur during request processing.
